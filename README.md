# Esme Click-Game

This is a React.js web application for a clicking memory game.

Users are presented with twelve images of my dog and must click each one without duplicating clicks on the same image. After each click the images are shuffled and the user must remember which images have been clicked. The app counts the user's score and stores the highest score achieved as a "Top Score."

This app's components include a Footer, Header, Nav, NavMessage, and Game. The Game component includes the programming for the game, while the others contain JSX to render styling and information to the user.

To play, visit the deployed application at the heroku link below, or clone this repository, run npm install, and npm start in a terminal.
